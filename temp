� 53· Existential Projection of an Authentic Being-towards-death
Factically, Dasein maintains itself proximally and for the most part in
an inauthentic Being-towards-death. How is the ontological possibility of
an authentic Being-towards-death to be characterized 'Objectively', if, in
the end, Dasein never comports itself authentically towards its end, or if,
in accordance with its very meaning, this authentic Being must remain
hidden from the Others ? Is it not a fanciful undertaking, to project the

existential possibility of so questionable an existentiell potentiality-for-
Being? What is needed, if such a projection is to go beyond a merely

fictitious arbitrary construction? Does Dasein itself give us any instruc-
tions for carrying it out ? And can any grounds for its phenomenal

legitimacy be taken from Dasein itself? Can our analysis of Dasein up to
this point give us any prescriptions for the ontological task we have now
set ourselves, so that what we have before us may be kept on a road of
which we can be sure ?
The existential conception of death has been established; and therewith

we have also established what it is that an authentic Being-towards-the-
end should be able to comport itself towards. We have also characterized

inauthentic Being-towards-death, and thus we have prescribed in a

negative way [prohibitiv] how it is possible for authentic Being-towards-
death not to be. It is with these positive and prohibitive instructions that

the existential edifice of an authentic Being-towards-death must let itself
be projected.
Dasein is constituted by disclosedness-that is, by an understanding

with a state-of-mind. Authentic Being-towards-death can not evade its own-
most non-relational possibility, or cover up this possibility by thus fleeing

1 'Weil das Dasein existiert, bestimmt es sich als Seiendes, wie es ist, je aus einer
Moglichkeit, die es selbst ist und versteht.'

II. I Being and Time
from it, or give a new explanation for it to accord with the common sense of

the "they". In our existential projection of an authentic Being-towards-
death, therefore, we must set forth those items in such a Being which are

constitutive for it as an understanding of death-and as such an under-
standing in the sense of Being towards this possibility without either

fleeing it or covering it up.
In the first instance, we must characterize Being-towards-death as a 261
Being towards a possibiliry-indeed, towards a distinctive possibility of

Dasein itself. "Being towards" a possibility-that is to say, towards some-
thing possible-may signify "Being out for" something possible, as in

concerning ourselves with its actualization, Such possibilities are con-
stantly encountered in the field of what is ready-to-hand and present-at-
hand-what is attainable, controllable, practicable, and the like. In

concernfully Being out for something possible, there is a tendency to
annihilate the possibility of the possible by making it available to us. But the
concernful actualization of equipment which is ready-to-hand (as in
producing it, getting it ready, readjusting it, and so on) is always merely
relative, since even that which has been actualized is still characterized
in terms of some involvements-indeed this is precisely what characterizes

its Being. Even though actualized, it remains, as actual, something pos-
sible for doing something; it is characterized by an "in-order-to". What

our analysis is to make plain is simply how Being out for something con-
cernfully, comports itself towards the possible : it does so not by the

theoretico-thematical consideration of the possible as possible, and by

having regard for its possibility as such, but rather by looking circum-
spectively away from the possible and looking at that for which it is possible

[das Wofiir-moglich].
Manifestly Being-towards-death, which is now in question, cannot have
the character of concernfully Being out to get itself actualized. For one
thing, death as possible is not something possible which is ready-to-hand
or present-at-hand, but a possibility of Dasein's Being. So to concern
oneself with actualizing what is thus possible would have to signify,
"bringing about one's demise", But if this were done, Dasein would
deprive itself of the very ground for an existing Being-towards-death.

Thus, ifby "Being towards death" we do not have in view an 'actuali-
zing' of death, neitheX

:

can we mean "dwelling upon the end in its pos-
sibility". This is the way one comports oneself when one 'thinks about

death', pondering over when and how this possibility may perhaps be
actualized. Of course such brooding over death does not fully take away
from it its character as a possibility. Indeed, it always gets brooded over as
something that is coming ; but in such brooding we weaken it by calculating

306 Being and Time II. I
how we are to have it at our disposal. As something possible, it is to

show as little as possible of its possibility. On the other hand, if Being-
towards-death has to disclose understandingly the possibility which we

have characterized, and if it is to disclose it as a possibility, then in such
Being-towards-death this possibility must not be weakened : it must be
understood as a possibility, it must be cultivated as a possibility, and we must
put up with it as a possibility, in the way we comport ourselves towards it.
However, Dasein comports itself towards something possible in its
possibility by expecting it [im Erwarten]. Anyone who is intent on something
262 possible, may encounter it unimpeded and undiminished in its 'whether

it comes or does not, or whether it comes after all' .1 But with this pheno-
menon of expecting, has not our analysis reached the same kind of Being

towards the possible to which we have already called attention in our

description of "Being out for something" concernfully? To expect some-
thing possible is always to understand it and to 'have' it with regard to

whether and when and how it will be actually present-at-hand. Expecting
is not just an occasional looking-away from the possible to its possible
actualization, but is essentially a waiting for that actualization [ ein Warten
auf diese]. Even in expecting, one leaps away from the possible and gets a
foothold in the actual. It is for its actuality that what is expected is
expected. By the very nature of expecting, the possible is drawn into the
actual, arising out of the actual and returning to it. 2
But Being towards this possibility, as Being-towards-death, is so to
comport ourselves towards death that in this Being, and for it, death
reveals itself as a possibility. Our terminology for such Being towards this
possibility is "anticipation" of this possibility. 3 But in this way of behaving
does there not lurk a coming-close to the possible, and when one is close
to the possible, does not its actualization emerge ? In this kind of coming
close, however, one does not tend towards concernfully making available

something actual ; but as one comes closer understandingly, the pos-
sibility of the possible just becomes 'greater'. The closest closeness which one

may have in Being towards death as a possibility, is as far as possible from anything
1 'Fur ein Gespanntsein auf es vermag ein Mogliches in seinem "ob oder nicht oder
schliesslich doch" ungehindert und ungeschmalert zu begegnen.'

2 'Auch im Erwarten liegt ein Abspringen vom Moglichen und Fussfassen im Wirk-
lichen, dafiir das Erwartete erwartet ist. Vom Wirklichen aus und auf es zu wird das

Mogliche in das Wirkliche erwartungsmassig hereingezogen.'

3 ' ••• Vorlaufen in die M oglichkeit.' While we have used 'anticipate' to translate 'vor-
greifen', which occurs rather seldom, we shall also use it-less literally-to translate

'vorlaufen', which appears very often in the following pages, and which has the special
connotation of 'running ahead'. But as Heidegger's remarks have indicated, the kind of
'anticipation' which is involved in Being-towards-death, does not consist in 'waiting for'
death or 'dwelling upon it' or :actualizing' it before it normally comes; nor does
'running ahead into it' in this se�e mean that we 'rush headlong into it'.

II. 1 Being and Time 307
actual. The more unveiledly this possibility gets understood, the more
purely does the understanding penetrate into it as the possibility of the
impossibility of any existence at all. Death, as possibility, gives Dasein nothing
to be 'actualized', nothing which Dasein, as actual, could itself be. It is
the possibility of the impossibility of every way of comporting oneself
towards anything, of every way of existing. In the anticipation of this
possibility it becomes 'greater and greater' ; that is to say, the possibility
reveals itself to be such that it knows no measure at all, no more or less,
but signifies the possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence.
In accordance with its essence, this possibility offers no support for
becoming intent on something, 'picturing' to oneself the actuality which

is possible, and so forgetting its possibility. Being-towards-death, as anti-
cipation of possibility, is what first makes this possibility possible, and sets

it free as possibility.
Being-towards-death is the anticipation of a potentiality-for-Being of
that entity whose kind of Being is anticipation itself. 1 In the anticipatory
revealing of this potentiality-for-Being, Dasein discloses itself to itself as
regards its uttermost possibility. But to project itself on its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being means to be able to understand itself in the Being
of the entity so revealed-namely, to exist. Anticipation turns out to be 263

the possibility of understanding one's ownmost and uttermost potentiality-
for-Being-that is to say, the possibility of authentic existence. The ontological

constitution of such existence must be made visible by setting forth the
concrete structure of anticipation of death. How are we to delimit this
structure phenomenally? Manifestly, we must do so by determining those
characteristics which must belong to an anticipatory disclosure so that it
can become the pure understanding of that ownmost possibility which is
non-relational and not to be outstripped-which is certain and, as such,
indefinite. It must be noted that understanding does not primarily mean

just gazing at a meaning, but rather understanding oneself in that poten-
tiality-for-Being which reveals itself in projection.xvu

Death is Dasein's ownmost possibility. Being towards this possibility dis-
closes to Dasein its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, in which its very Being is

the issue. Here it can become manifest to Dasein that in this distinctive
possibility of its own self, it has been wrenched away from the "they".
This means that in anticipation any Dasein can have wrenched itself away
from the "they" already. But when one understands that this is somethi�g
which Dasein 'can' have done, this only reveals its factical lostness in the
everydayness of the they-sel£
1 ' ••. dessen Seinsart das Vorlaufen selbst ist.' The earlier editions have 'hat' instead
of 'ist'.

308 Being and Time II. I
The ownmost possibility is non-relational. Anticipation allows Dasein to
understand that that potentiality-for-being in which its ownmost Being is
an issue, must be taken over by Dasein alone. Death does not just 'belong'
to one's own Dasein in an undifferentiated way; death lays claim to it as
an individual Dasein. The non-relational character of death, as understood
in anticipation, individualizes Dasein down to itself. This individualizing
is a way in which the 'there' is disclosed for existence. It makes xnanifest
that all Being-alongside the things with which we concern ourselves, and

all Being-with Others, will fail us when our ownmost potentiality-for-
Being is the issue. Dasein .can be authentically itself only if it xnakes this

possible for itself of its own accord. But if concern and solicitude fail us,
this does not signify at all that these ways of Dasein have been cut off
from its authentically Being-its-Self. As structures essential to Dasein's
constitution, these have a share in conditioning the possibility of any
existence whatsoever. Dasein is authentically itself only to the extent that,
as concernful Being-alongside and solicitous Being-with, it projects itself
upon its ownmost potentiality-for-Being rather than upon the possibility
ofthe they-self. The entity which anticipates its non-relational possibility,
264 is thus forced by that very anticipation into the possibility of taking over
from itself its ownmost Being, and doing so of its own accord.
The ownmost, non-relational possibility is not to be outstripped. Being
towards this possibility enables Dasein to understand that giving itself up
impends for it as the uttermost possibility of its existence. Anticipation,
however, unlike inauthentic Being-towards-death, does not evade the
fact that death is not to be outstripped ; instead, anticipation frees itself
for accepting this. When, by anticipation, one becomes free for one's own
death, one is liberated from one's lostness in those possibilities which may
accidentally thrust the�nselves upon one ; and one is liberated in such a
way that for the first time one can authentically understand and choose
among the factical possibilities lying ahead of that possibility which is

not to be outstripped.1 Anticipation discloses to existence that its utter-
most possibility lies in giving itself up, and thus it shatters all one's tena-
ciousness to whatever existence one has reached. In anticipation, Dasein

guards itself a�ainst falling back behind itself, or behind the potentiality-
for-Being which it has understood. It guards itself against 'becoming too

old for its victories' (Nietzsche) . Free for its ownmost possibilities, which
are determined by the end and so are understood as finite [endliche], Dasein
dispels the danger that it may, by its own finite understanding of existence,
fail to recognize that it is getting outstripped by the existence-possibilities
of Others, or rather that it may explain these possibilities wrongly and
1 ' ••• die der uniiberholbaren vorgelagert sind.' See note 1, p. gog, H. 259 above.

II. I Being and Time
force them back upon its own, so that it may divest itself of its ownmost
factical existence. As the non-relational possibility, death individualizes

-but only in such a manner that, as the possibility which is not to be out-
stripped, it makes Dasein, as Being-with, have some understar{ding of the

potentiality-for-Being of Others. Since anticipation of the possibility which
is not to be outstripped discloses also all the possibilities which lie ahead
of that possibility, this anticipation includes the possibility of taking the
whole of Dasein in advance [V orwegnehmens] in an existentiell manner;

that is to say, it includes the possibility of existing as a whole potentiality-
for-Being.

The ownmost, non-relational possibility, which is not to be outstripped,
is certain. The way to be certain of it is determined by the kind of truth
which corresponds to it (disclosedness). The certain possibility of death,
however, discloses Dasein as a possibility, but does so only in such a way
that, in anticipating this possibility, Dasein makes this possibility possible for
itself as its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. 1 The possibility is disclosed
because it is made possible in anticipation. To maintain oneself in this
truth-that is, to be certain of what has been disclosed-demands all
the more that one should anticipate. We cannot compute the certainty of
death by ascertaining how many cases of death we encounter. This
certainty is by no means of the kind which Inaintains itself in the truth of

the present-at-hand. When something present-at-hand has been un-
covered, it is encountered most purely if we just look at the entity and let

it be encountered in itself. Dasein must first have lost itself in the factual
circumstances [Sachverhalte] (this can be one of care's own tasks and 265
possibilities) if it is to obtain the pure objectivity-that is to say, the
indifference-of apodictic evidence. If Being-certain in relation to death
does not have this character, this does not mean thadt is of a lower grade,
but that it does not belong at all to the graded order of the kinds of evidence we can
have about the present-at-hand.
Holding death for true (death is just one's own) shows another kind of
certainty, and is more primordial than any certainty which relates to
entities encountered within-the-world, or to formal objects ; for it is
certain of Being-in-the-world. As such, holding death for true does not
demand just one definite kind of behaviour in Dasein, but demands Dasein

itself in the full authenticity of its existence.xviu In anticipation Dasein
can first make certain of its ownmost Being in its totality-a totality
which is not to be outstripped. Therefore the evidential character which
belongs to the immediate givenness of Experiences, of the "I", or of

consciousness, must necessarily lag behind the certainty which anticipa-
tion includes. Yet this is not because the way in which these are grasped

would not be a rigorous one, but because in principle such a way of
grasping them cannot holdfor true (disclosed) something which at bottom
it insists upon 'having there' as true : namely, Dasein itself, which I
myself am, and which, as a potentiality-for-Being, I can be authentically
only by anticipation.
The ownmost possibility, which is-non-rel�tional, not to be outstripped,
and certain, is indefinite as regards its certainty. J-Iow does anticipation
disclose this characteristic ofDasein's distinctive possibility ? How does the
anticipatory understanding project itself upon a potentiality-for-Being
which is certain and which is constantly possible in such a way that the
"when" in which the utter impossibility of existence becomes possible
remains constantly indefinite ? In anticipating [ zum] the indefinite
certainty of death, Dasein opens itself to a constant threat arising out of its
own "there". In this very threat Being-towards-the-end must maintain
itself. So little can it tone this down that it must rather cultivate the
indefiniteness of the certainty. How is it existentially possible for this

constant threat to be genuinely disclosed ? All understanding is accom-
panied by a state-of-mind. Dasein's mood brings it face to face with the

thrownness of its 'that it is there' ,xi.X But the state-of-mind which can hold

open the utter and constant threat to itself arising from Dasein' s ownmost individual-
266 i.{.ed Being, is anxiety.xx 1 In this state-of-mind, Dasein finds itself face to face

with the "nothing" of the possible impossibility of its existence. Anxiety
is anxious about the potentiality-for-Being of the entity so destined [des so

bestimmten Seienden], and in this way it discloses the uttermost pos-
sibility. Anticipation utterly individualizes Dasein, and allows it, in this

individualization of itself, to become certain of the totality of its potenti-
ality-for-Being. For this reason, anxiety as a basic state-of-mind belongs

to such a self-understanding of Dasein on the basis of Dasein itself. 2
Being-towards-death is essentially anxiety. This is attested unmistakably,
though 'only' indirectly, by Being-towards-death as we have described it,
1 'Die Bejindlichlr.eitaber, welche die stiindige und schlechthinnige, aus dem eigensten vereinzelten
Sein des Dasiens aufsteigende Bedrohung seiner selbst offen zu halten vermag, ist die Angst.' Notice
that 'welche' may be construed either as the subject or as the direct object of the relative
clause.
2 • ••• gehort zu diesem Sichverstehen des Daseins a us seinem Grunde die Gnmd-.

befindlichkeit der Angst.' It is not grammatically clear whether 'seinem' refers to ·s,ch-
verstehen' or to 'Daseins'.

II. 1 Being and Time
when it perverts anxiety into cowardly fear and, in surmounting this fear,
only makes known its own cowardliness in the face of anxiety.

We may now summarize our characterization of authentic Being-
towards-death as we have projected it existentially : anticipation reveals to

Dasein its lostness in the they-self, and brings it face to face with the possibility of
being itself, primarily unsupported by concemful solicitude, but of being itself, rather,
in an impassioned freedom towards death-a freedom which has been released
from the Illusions of the "they", and which is factical, certain of itself, and anxious.
All the relationships which belong to Being-towards-death, up to the
full content of Dasein's uttermost possibility, as we have characterized it,
constitute an anticipation which they combine in revealing, unfolding,

and holding fast, as that which makes this possibility possible. The existen-
tial projection in which anticipation has been delimited, has made visible

the ontological possibility of an existentiell Being-towards-death which is
authentic. Therewith, however, the possibility of Dasein's having an
authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole emerges, but only as an ontological
possibility. In our existential projection of anticipation, we have of course
clung to those structures of Dasein which we have arrived at earlier, and
we have, as it were, let Dasein itself project itself upon this possibility,

without holding up to Dasein an ideal of existence with any special 'con-
tent', or forcing any such ideal upon it 'from outside'. Nevertheless, this

existentially 'possible' Being-towards-death remains, from the existentiell

point of view, a fantastical exaction. The fact that an authentic potentiality-
for-Being-a-whole is ontologically possible for Dasein, signifies nothing, so

long as a correspondingontical potentiality-for-Being has not been demon-
strated in Dasein itself. Does Dasein ever factically throw itself into such

a Being-towards-death ? Does Dasein demand, even by reason of its own-
mostBeing, an authentic potentiality-for-Being determined by anticipation?

Before answering these questions, we must investigate whether to any 267

extent and in anyway Dasein gives testimony, from its ownmost potentiality-
for-Being, as to a possible authenticity of its existence, so that it not only

makes known that in an existentiell manner such authenticity is possible,
but demands this of itself.
The question of Dasein's authentic Being-a-whole and of its existential
constitution still hangs in mid-air. It can be put on a phenomenal basis
which will stand the test only if it can cling to a possible authenticity of
its Being which is attested by Dasein itself. If we succeed in uncovering
that attestation phenomenologically, together with what it attests, then
the problem will arise anew as to whether the anticipation of [zum] death,
which we have hitherto projected only in its ontological possibility, has an essential
connection with that authentic potentiality-for-Being which has been attested.
